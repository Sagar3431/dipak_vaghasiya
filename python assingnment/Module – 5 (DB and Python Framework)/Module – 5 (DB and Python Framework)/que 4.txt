What is Django URLs?make program to create django urls

Django URLs are the foundation of how website's different pages and views are connected. They act like addresses 
that users and search engines use to navigate your site. 
 
URL Patterns:  URLs in Django are defined within a special file called urls.py.  This file contains a list of patterns 
that map URLs to specific views in your Django application.
 

 
 
Creating Django URLs:   

 
 
Open myproject/myproject/urls.py and add the following: 
      

      from django.contrib import admin 
      from django.urls import path, include 
urlpatterns = [ 
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls), 
      path('', include('myapp.urls')),  # Add your app's URLs here 
  ] 
   
 

 
 
Open myapp/urls.py and create patterns for your views: 
     

     from django.urls import path 
     from . import views 
urlpatterns = [ 
     path('', views.home, name='home'),  # URL for the home page 
     path('about/', views.about, name='about'),  # URL for the about page 
 ]
