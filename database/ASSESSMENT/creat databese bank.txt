Also fetch the details of the account holder who are related from the same
city 
ans:-
SELECT account_holder.account_holder_name AS "sagar vaghasiya", branch.branch_name, branch.branch_city FROM account_holder,branch WHERE account_holder.account_holder_name=branch.branch_name;

● Write a query to fetch account number and account holder name, whose
accounts were created after 15th of any month
ans:-SELECT  am.customer_number, firstname, account_number
FROM customer_master cm INNER JOIN account_master am
ON cm.customer_number=am.customer_number
WHERE extract(day from account_opening_date)>15
ORDER BY am.customer_number, account_number
● Write a query to display the city name and count the branches in that city.
Give the count of branches an alias name of Count_Branch.
ans:-SELECT count(account_holder_id) account_Count FROM account_holder WHERE city='ahmedabad';

● Write a query to display the account holder’s id, account holder’s name,
branch id, and loan amount for people who have taken loans. (NOTE : use
sql join concept to solve the query)
ans:-
SELECT account_holder.account_holder_id, account_holder.account_holder_name, branch.branch_id, branch.branch_name
FROM account_holder
INNER JOIN branch
ON branch.branch_id = account_holder.account_holder_id
